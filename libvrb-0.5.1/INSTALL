If you have not read file "README", you should.


Installation:

There is a script called "configure" which requires either bash or ksh
to run.  It first runs via /bin/sh and determines whether /bin/bash or
/bin/ksh is present, then writes out a copy of itself to use that shell
interpreter, then runs that copy.  This script scans all the files and
builds the Makefiles needed to compile VRB.  It also includes a special
command used during compilation to extract function prototypes as well
as macro definitions from .c sources to build .h headers.  This allows
for a single point of definition which makes it easy to develop more
functions and programs, and not have to keep other files in sync all
the time.

The "configure" script will take a "--prefix=" option to specify the
installation location for the library.  It also takes a few variations
to control the installation specificall for different classes of files.
The default installation target is a temporary directory in /tmp so it
is necessary to actually specific "--prefix=" to do a permanent install
in a usual place like /usr/local.  This information is used only to
build the Makefiles to do the installation.  It is not copied into the
code or headers.  This means that you can choose to manually copy all
the files from the temporary installation, or just build a tarball from
the temporary installation.

Simply execute it like:

    ./configure

or like:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Once it builds the various Makefiles, then you can do:

    make clean
    make install

You can also do just "make" to see it compile without installing.

Installation includes the library, version symlinks for the library, header
files, and demo programs.  There are also test programs but those are not
installed.  The demo programs differ from the test programs in that the
demo programs have some potential uses.

You will need to update your system library cache.  Read your system man
page for "ldconfig" for particulars.

Man pages are also included, but they are NOT installed automatically.
They will need to be copied manually to install them.


Warning:

This is an BETA release.  API's are NOT finalized and may change without
specific mention of the changes being made.  While I encourage others to
use the library, at present I do not encourage distribution of programs
that use the library until a final release.
