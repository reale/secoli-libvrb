.TH vrb_read_min 3 2002-09-30 vrb "VRB Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
vrb_read_min - read a minimum of data into a VRB
.SH LIBRARY
.B -lvrb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <vrb.h>
.sp
.IB "size_t " "vrb_read_min" "(vrb_p " "vrb" ", int " "fd" ", size_t " "maxsize" ", size_t " "minsize" ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vrb_read_min
reads a minimum amount of data from a specified open file descriptor
using
.B read(2)
into the specified
virtual ring buffer until the specified maximum length has been read,
the buffer is full, or end-of-file, or an error is returned
(including EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK for a non-blocking descriptor).
If there is insufficient space in the buffer to read the minimum amount,
then
.B read(2)
will not be called.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IB "vrb_p " vrb
.br
specifies which virtual ring buffer.
.sp
.IB "int " fd
.br
specifies the open file descriptor to read from
.sp
.IB "size_t " maxsize
.br
specifies the maximum length to read, or
.B "~0"
for unlimited.
.sp
.IB "size_t " minsize
.br
specifies the minimum length to read.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.I size_t
.br
If successful, the actual length of data read into the buffer is returned.
If the minimum amount of space was not available to read into,
0 is returned.
If end-of-file occurs, the return value is ~0 and errno is 0.
If an error occurs from
.B read(2),
the return value is ~0 and
errno is set by
.B read(2).
.SH ERRORS
If an error is returned, then
.I errno
will have one of the following values:
.TP
.B 0
An end-of-file has occurred.
Note that this is a different way of returning an end-of-file
condition than
.B read(2)
uses.
.TP
.B EINVAL
An invalid virtual ring buffer pointer was specified.
